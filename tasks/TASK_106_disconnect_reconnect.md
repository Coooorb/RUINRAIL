# TASK 106 — Disconnect, Reconnect Grace and Host Failure

> **Status:** Approved implementation task for the RUINRAIL V1/MVP roadmap.
> **Execution mode:** May be run individually or by the approved Autonomous Task Runner.
> **Game/code language:** English.

## PREREQUISITES

- TASK 105 must be complete or independently audited as already satisfied.
- Preserve the confirmed implementation state from all earlier completed tasks.
- If an earlier dependency is missing or broken, stop and report the dependency failure instead of inventing a substitute architecture.

## GOAL

Implement MVP disconnect semantics: client ~60s grace, Dead fallback, and host disconnect expedition failure.

## FILES TO READ

Read this task, `CLAUDE.md`, `technical/117_CODING_RULES_FOR_CLAUDE.md`, and the following direct specifications before editing code:

- `multiplayer/85_DISCONNECTS_SPECTATOR.md`
- `multiplayer/80_MULTIPLAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `technical/113_SAVE_PERSISTENCE.md`

Do not bulk-read the entire GDD. Read one additional specification only when a concrete direct dependency requires it, and record why in the completion report.

## ASSUMED EXISTING STATE

- Inspect the current repository before coding. Reuse the systems proven by earlier tasks instead of recreating them.
- Existing automated tests are regression contracts. Preserve them unless an approved specification intentionally changes the behavior.
- Use ScriptableObjects for shared immutable definitions/balance data and runtime objects/instances for mutable per-run/per-player state, following the data-architecture specs.
- Keep host-authoritative/network-ready boundaries where the existing architecture already provides them, but do not implement networking before its assigned tasks.

## REQUIREMENTS

1. On client disconnect during expedition, keep character/state represented and at risk for ~60s reconnect grace; reserve session/player identity for reconnection.
2. Reconnecting within grace rebinds ownership/input to the same authoritative player state/item instances without duplicating inventory.
3. Grace expiry treats player as Dead; gear is not dropped to teammates.
4. Host disconnect ends session/expedition for everyone and resolves at-risk state as failure; no host migration in V1.
5. Solo quit/application restart follows existing failure/no-resume rule.

## DO NOT IMPLEMENT

- Do not implement systems assigned to later tasks early unless this task explicitly requires a narrow integration seam.
- Do not introduce PvP, classes, stamina, durability, crafting, Gear Score, critical hits, weak spots, extra currencies, or unapproved ammo categories.
- Do not silently rebalance approved V1 values. Keep approved constants data-driven where the architecture calls for data.
- Do not replace working implementations from earlier tasks with parallel/duplicate systems. Extend the confirmed repository state.
- Do not perform unrelated refactors, package upgrades, Unity-version changes, or architectural rewrites.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. Reconnect within grace restores same item/player IDs once.
2. Grace expiry transitions once to Dead and never drops gear.
3. Host failure triggers one failure transaction for all affected players without partial extraction.
4. No host migration code exists.

## TESTS

- The Unity project must compile after the task.
- Add focused automated tests for the behavior introduced by this task and for its important edge cases.
- Run the repository test harness after implementation:
  `UNITY_PATH="/c/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.3.24f1/Editor/Unity.exe" bash scripts/run-unity-tests.sh All`
- A zero-test run is a failure. Never report PASS for tests that did not actually run.
- Existing relevant EditMode and PlayMode suites must remain green.
- If Unity or an external service is unavailable, report the affected check as `NOT RUN` with the exact reason; never fabricate a result.

## TASK-SPECIFIC NOTES

- Network disconnect + persistence is high risk. Any duplication/loss race is a hard blocker.

## EXPECTED FILES CHANGED

Only production/data/editor/test files directly required by this task. Keep the diff narrow and reviewable.

## COMPLETION REPORT

At task end report:
1. Files created/changed.
2. What was implemented and how it integrates with existing systems.
3. Exact approved/tunable values used, including any explicitly temporary prototype defaults.
4. Exact test commands actually run and exact PASS/FAIL/NOT RUN results.
5. Acceptance-criteria status item by item.
6. Known limitations, unresolved specification conflicts, external-asset blockers, or follow-up dependencies.

In normal single-task mode, stop before TASK 107. Under `production/130_AUTONOMOUS_TASK_RUNNER.md`, write the checkpoint to the autonomous run log and continue only if the runner's gate rules permit it.
